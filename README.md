# stock_proj

This is a stock market predictor written in Python using pandas and scikit-learn. The stock_data_formatter.py formats the data from the source(yahoo finance) into a form which can be fed into the scikit-learn models. ml_models.py experiments with various models to find the best model for a particular data set. Elastic Nets is found to be a very good model for the data sets we have experimented with. DataSets directory lists the datasets used for this project.
